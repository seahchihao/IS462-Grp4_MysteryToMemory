  subtitle: 'Captured by his son, this photo shows Johnny enjoying his usual daily
    walks in the park, soaking in the quieter and tranquil atmosphere in the park
    amongst the hustle and bustle of the city. He would often bring his grandchildren
    on his walks so that they could play at the playground. It always brought smiles
    seeing his grandchildren play as it reminded him of his youthful days. '
