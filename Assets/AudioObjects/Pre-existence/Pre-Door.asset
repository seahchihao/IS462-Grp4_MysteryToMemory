  subtitle: Wow! A door has appeared! Before you go in, let me explain what's going
    to happen. You will go through several scenes depicting stages in Johnny's life,
    and in each scene you have to find a key photo of Johnny. After finding it, you
    will be able to proceed to the next scene. Good luck!
