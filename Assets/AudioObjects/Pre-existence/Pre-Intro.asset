  subtitle: "Welcome, dear traveller. You now stand in the space before time \u2014
    a quiet beginning. Before you lies a stone, holding the weight of a life once
    lived. Step forward. And when you're ready, awaken the story. In each chapter
    that follows, a memory awaits \u2014 a photo, once real, now part of what remains.
    Find it, and witness Johnny\u2019s life, as it was remembered."
